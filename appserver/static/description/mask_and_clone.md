###  Example log line

    09-18-2020 10:02:11.793 +0100 INFO  LicenseUsage - type=Usage s="my_host" st="m_sourcetype" h="my_host" o="" idx="default" i="18F9C3EA-EBB2-497C-801A-098D0C52F9E2" pool="auto_generated_pool_enterprise" b=2034451 poolsz=53687091200

### The steps performed to process data

1. 

#### props.conf

    # This sourcetype is cloned and the clone has masking applied, the orignal remains untouched and is routed to the 'secure' index
    [mask_and_clone]
    TIME_PREFIX = ^â€º
    TIME_FORMAT = %H:%M:%S %y-%m-%d
    SHOULD_LINEMERGE=false
    LINE_BREAKER=([\n\r]+) 
    # this transform will create a new event with a tempoary sourcetype
    TRANSFORMS-apply-masking=mask_and_clone-clone

    # we intercept the tempory sourcetype, apply some sed transforms, rename the sourcetype to the original and route to another 'insecure' index
    [mask_and_clone-clone]
    # because we have created a new event we can apply a SED transform to the newly created event
    # we could use the INGEST_EVAL replace function to do this, but using SED is slighly more elegent and is likely use a faster engine and the replace function.
    # Note that we have specfied two SED commands separated by a space
    SEDCMD-mask = s/email_address=(\S\S)\S*(.)@(.)\S*(\S\S\S)\s/email_address=\1..\2@\3..\4 /g s/password=\S+/password=#######/g
    # we need to route this new event to another index to prove our solution
    TRANSFORMS-route-to-index = shared-drop_useless_time_fields, mask_and_clone-route_to_index
    # we can set the sourcetype back to the orginal
    rename = mask_and_clone

#### transforms.conf

    # we create a clone
    [mask_and_clone-clone]
    SOURCE_KEY = Meta:Host
    DEST_KEY = Meta:Host
    REGEX = (.)
    FORMAT = %0
    CLONE_SOURCETYPE = mask_and_clone-clone

    # routes the cloned data to a different index
    [shared-route_to_ingest_eval_examples_2]
    INGEST_EVAL = index="ingest_eval_examples_2"
